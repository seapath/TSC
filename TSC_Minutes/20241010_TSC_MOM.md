## Discussions

- Change of TSC time
	- 3PM instead of 4PM CET
	- Will change if no objection
- Update on branch merges and Seapath release
	- Presentation by Paul Le Guen de Kerneizon (Savoir-faire Linux)
		- `20241010_TSC_Seapath_merge_status.pdf`
	- Effort to align Ceph/Ceph-Ansible on the Yocto branch to the Debian branch
	- Seapath Yocto Kirkstone
		- Ceph 16 ported to Yocto kirkstone branch
		- Problems and limitations encountered:
			- Ceph 16 is not officially supported on Yocto Kirkstone
			- Ceph 16 is deprecated
			- Ansible 2.10 is required for Ceph-ansible of Ceph 16, and Yocto kirkstone has use Python 3.10.5 that is not compatible with Ansible 2.10
				- --> Backports and patches had to be done, error prone
		- Use of these deprecated tools should be temporary
	- Seapath Yocto Scarthgap
		- Tried to use Ceph 16 to keep versions aligned
			- Note: Ceph 18 could be use with Debian 12 with a backport
		- Scarthgap has python 3.12, which again has compatibility issues with Ansible 2.10 required with Ceph 16
		- Deprecation issues:
			- Ceph 16 not officially maintained anymore
				- Debian package of Ceph 16 is still maintained by the Debian team
			- Ceph-ansible 6, needed for Ceph 16 is almost deprecated
			- Ansible 2.10 deprecated still 23th May 2023
		- Possible solutions:
			- Use Ceph-Adm, which is maintained, instead of the almost deprecated Ceph-Ansible
				- Ceph-Adm is not dependant on the Ceph version used
				- More lasting solution, but will need more work for integration
					- Both for Seapath and for the existing projects using Seapath
					- Need to do integration in Seapath Ansible
				- Yair added that Ceph-Adm is lighter and supposed to be easier to used than Ceph-Ansible
			- Use the main branch of Ceph-Ansible
				- Require the use of Ceph 18 on both Yocto and Debian
				- Need Ansible 2.15 or Ansible 2.16, still maintained
				- Still the need to update Ceph-Ansible each time Ceph must be upgraded
	- Meeting to talk about the technical aspects of Ceph-Adm integration
		- Will be organised shortly
		- Need to estimate the required tasks and work time
		- People to include
			- Yair Podemsky (Red Hat)
			- Florent Carli (RTE)
			- Erwann Roussy (Savoir-faire Linux)
- Seapath on ARM
	- Seapath is supposed to be platform agnostics
	- SFL was contacted by people interested
	- SFL working on a POC of a Seapath observer on Raspberry Pi
	- Bastien Desbos (RTE) noted that VMs and applications on VMs should be ARM compatible
		- Bastien has no knowledge of existing applications for ARM
- SEAPATH at Enlit Europe
	- Eloi Bail (Savoir-faire Linux) will be there and will represent Seapath
	- 22th to 24th of October
- TSC organization
	-  Proposal of preliminary Slack meeting before a TSC to set the topics to talk about
		- Jan Hille (Welotec) propose to have a platform where to submit topics
		- Bastien Desbos (RTE) propose to have a document were to write the current main goals of the project
			- Bastien will start a draft
	- Possibility to use AI to generate MOM from TSC recordings
