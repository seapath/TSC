**release**

follow yocto rules => kingstone branch might be the base (April 2022)
minimum cores => minimum effort so all the features that are not identified as the core of the project should be maintain on a best effort basis
kernel =>  use only one version per release branch and follow the kernel lts evolution

Use the github tools to release the different version
