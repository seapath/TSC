# Discussion

- LF Energy Summit 2024
	- Multiple SFL presentations
	- Proposition for a Seapath meeting there
- SEAPATH cyber-security audit
	- Still going on but almost finished, 90% done
	- Good feedback on audit
		- Some elements to improve
		- Seapath project use generally good practices
- Cockpit cluster plugins
	- Presentation by Tanguy (SFL) of his work
	- Plugins are open-sourced on Github with CI
	- **Questions**
		- *"Are changes done through the plugin UI reflected in Ansible playbooks/inventories ?"*
			- Not possible, but the reverse is true
			- Purpose is not to mix too much Ansible or cockpit plugin, but rather have a tool for manual maintenance through UI
		- *"Did you looked at Ansible Tower as UI ?"*
			- Thinking was done, but not chosen for this work
			- Ansible tower is out of scope for now
- Managing network on Seapath with Netplan
	- Goals: simplify network configuration
	- Seapath already allows to partially configure the network with systemd networkd via Ansible
	- Support for networkd and netplan should coexist in Seapath
		- Netplan is not compatible with some specific configuration cases
		- Keep backward compatibility, needed by RTE
	- **Questions**
		- *"How is Netplan integrated with Ansible ?"*
			- Possibility to write Netplan template files and use them with Ansible playbooks
		- *"Can Netplan configure OVS stuff ?"*
			- Partially, to the extend of what is supported by Netplan
			- E.g.: not possible to define VXLan parameters for OVS bridges
				- ==> Contact Netplan community, possible contribution ?
- **General questions and remarks**
	- *"Debian Seapath, should packages be pinned by version for reproducible build ?"*
		- Packages could be pinned for each installation
		- Some people would like to not have some packages updated automatically to keep same configuration of distribution over time
			- Management of update by hand
		- Florent (RTE) says Debian approach should be updating regularly with Debian updates without pinning packages
		- Florent (RTE) think that package version management is out of the scope of Seapath and should be dealt by each client
			- E.g.: local mirors of packages, ...
	- *"Debian Seapath, should we update from/to LTS kernels ?"*
		- Debian kernels =/= Linux mainline LTS kernel
	- *"What are the priorities for the organisation of Seapath repos ?"*
		- Question of the two branches for Yocto and Debian ==> "terrible idea" for Daniel (Welotec)
		- Branch merge POC should be done in a few weeks
			- Need to work with other Seapath members for this
		- Alexander (Red Hat) would like more discussion on the matter first
			- ==> Need to organise a meeting in the upcoming weeks for this with RTE, RedHat, SFL, ...
