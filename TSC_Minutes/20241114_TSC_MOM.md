## Discussions

About the merge of branches
    - Most of the work is done. The merge could happen soon
About the release
    - Work to do
        - The merge must be done
        - Documentation must be updated and clear
        - ceph-adm will be treated after the first release
    - Release plan
        - Use Yocto Scarthgap and Debian 12
Questions about latency tests
    - Latency tests done on Debian CI are not "latency" tests but more "regularity" tests.
        - The code is old and not open source
        - It should be replaced with real latency tests that are done on the Yocto CI
    - The CentOS CI will not implement these latency tests for now and wait for the merge of the CI.
