## Discussion

- Cybersecurity auditing
    - presentation of Ostif
    - presentation of Adalogics
    - scope of Cybersecurity auditing
        - Focus on IEC 62443
        - 5 weeks of total time with interruption
        - IEC 62443 is a large standard and we can not certify Seapath with IEC62443 for the moment
        - Goal:
            - To find out how SEAPATH perform against the standard and evaluate
            - Publish a report with LF
            - Make sure that SEAPATH are on the good way to be certified
        - Eloi will create a working group
            - RTE (TBD)
            - Jan from Welotec
            - Savoir-faire Linux
            - Schneider (TBD)

- UI on SEAPATH

    - 2 approaches:
        - Ansible (Infrastructure as a code)
        - Interface (ex: cockpit)
        - Both are complementary
        - The use of Ansible is a strength to scale the management of substation

    - Schneider is using Cockpit and has positive feedbacks
