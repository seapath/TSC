		- `<PATCH>`: for bugs and security fixes
	- Git workflow
		- New changes are always done on main
		- Version branches only created if necessary to backport fixes to previous versions
	- Open question: how often to do releases ?
		- Time based? When there are a lot of changes?
		- Bastien Desbos (RTE) doesn't see the point of having periodic releases
			- Think releases should be done when there is a need or enough changes
		- Periodic releases is easiest for some people
		- Eloi Bail (SFL) thinks it is too early in the SEAPATH development to decide of a fixed cycle release
	- Will continue doing fixed releases

		- Is it still SEAPATH if it doesn't have every elements such as RT?
