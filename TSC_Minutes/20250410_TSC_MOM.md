- Questions & discussions
	- What to do for already in production SEAPATH when an important element such as ceph-ansible is deprecated and replaced by something else?
		- Easy answer for the projet would be to say that support in SEAPATH is moving to the new supported tool
		- Need to assess in TSC possibilities for SEAPATH supporting deprecated tools such as ceph-ansible to maintain compatibility
	- Yair Podemsky (Red Hat) would like to know if SEAPATH CentOS can be presented as an officially supported SEAPATH distribution now that the CentOS CI is up
		- Remark about lack of test, especially cukinia hardening tests
			- Hardening not yet done, relevant cukinia tests will be added when ready
			- Need to go on what is already done on other SEAPATH distribution to do it on CentOS, also check what is needed specifically for CentOS
		- Concerns about security testing
			- CentOS less mature than Yocto and Debian versions
