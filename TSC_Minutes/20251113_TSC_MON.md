## Discussions
- Simplifying SEAPATH installation
- Why an installer for SEAPATH?
- Current installers:
    - Complicated
    - Not universal (two installers)
    - Not flexible
- Goals of the SEAPATH installer:
    - Simple GUI
    - Universal (Yocto & Debian)
    - Customizable (for example: SSH key, keymaps, etc.)
- Main components:
    - **seapath-live-installer**, based on Debian Live-Build
    - **seapath-installer**, using Calamares for the GUI and installation framework
- SEAPATH installer source code:
    - Available on GitHub
	    - https://github.com/seapath/seapath-installer
	    - https://github.com/seapath/seapath-live-installer
- SEAPATH installer demo:
    - Live demo on Advantech ECU-579
- SEAPATH installer future work:
    - UI improvements
    - Extended SEAPATH configuration
    - “Seed installation”
    - Set up a proper translation workflow
    - Add more translation
## Questions & Discussions

- **Julien Tournier**
    
    - Will it be possible to customize the root password?
        
        - Not yet, but feasible.
            
    - How is _seapath-live-installer_ built? Is it Yocto-based?
        
        - It is available on GitHub and based on Debian.
        - It is possible to use another base, including Yocto.
            
- **Laurent Morin**
    
    - Asked whether tools are available to set up clustering.
        
        - Clustering uses Ansible.
        - Question raised about embedding Ansible during installation.
            
- **Maxime Pelletier**
    
    - Has the installer been tested by someone else in the community?
        
        - Not yet. It was released on Monday.
            
    - Is it possible to add custom images?
        
        - The SEAPATH installer comes with pre-built images, but custom SEAPATH images can be added.  Optional description files can be provided to improve how images appear during installation.
            
- **Paul & Aiswarya**
    
    - Presented and explained the SEAPATH installer GitHub repositories and how to customize the installer.
    - Pre-generated ISO files will be added soon.
        
- **Maxime Pelletier**
    
    - Who is going to Enlit?
        
        - Eloi Bail & Mathieu Dupré (Savoir-faire Linux). They will have a booth with SEAPATH demos alongside SMPnet and GE Vernova.
        - Maxime Pelletier (RTE) will be present and give a talk about SEAPATH.
        - Daniel Schaefer (Red Hat) will also have a booth.
        - SMPnet will demo their Omega VM running on SEAPATH at the SFL booth.
        - Tony Milne (Advantech) will be at the Advantech booth.
            
- **Marcelo Tosatti**
    
    - Does CI work on both Yocto and Debian?
        
        - Yes. CI exists for Yocto, Debian, CentOS and Oracle Linux.
            
    - Is CentOS disabled?
        
        - No, it has never been disabled, only temporarily inaccessible.
            
    - Is there a description of default users?
        
        - It depends on the flavor.
        - Yocto includes an additional local rescue user: **emergadmin**.
        - All systems include default **admin** and **ansible** users.
        - Flavors should be aligned regarding user accounts.
            
- **Additional note**
    
    - Erwann Roussy (Savoir-faire Linux) is giving a SEAPATH beginner webinar at 16:00.
