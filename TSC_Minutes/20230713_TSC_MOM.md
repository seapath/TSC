- Presentation of all TSC attenders

- Summary of talks done on Seapath (OSS NA, eOSS) and next talks
    - Video available on Youtube (a seperate email will be sent)
    - Eloi Bail had discussion about SBOM with Kate Stewart (according to her, SBOM is well supported on Yocto but impossible/hard to achieve with Debian)
    - Eloi Bail has discussion with Civil Infrastructure Platform CIP about potential synergies with Seapath, he will present that to Seapath TSC

- Seapath-debian on Debian 12
    - Bastien Desbos explained that RTE would like to switch to Debian 12 but will first evaluate the effort

    - this was reported by Schneider. Philippe Cizaire will check internally.
    - Eloi advice to open Github issues for that

- PRP on Seapath
    - Eloi Bail detailed the approaches
        - HW: 
            - pro deterministic, no impact on perf
            - cons: expensive. support of PTP, SR-IOV

        - SW:
            - impact on latency

        - Stack on Linuxi:
            - generic stack with interrupt model

            - Kernel bypassing (DPDK, VDD) 

    - Mathieu Dupré explained his exploration on PRP with Seapath
    - Mital Kanamar mentioned that we might have issues with PTP over PRP
    - Mathieu Dupré will prepare an accurate description of its architecture

- UI on Seapath for monitoring
    - According to Philippe Cizaire, the UI will be done by Seapath user directly
    - Seapath might offer data and low layers
    - Eloi Bail said that we could offer a generic UI as a demonstrator
