## Discussion

- TSC voting members clarification
    - The meritocracy rule is used to establish a voting member
        - RTE: Bastien Desbos
        - Savoir-faire Linux: Eloi Bail
        - Schneider: Alban Denat
        - GE: David Macdonald
        - Welotec: Jan Hille

- Move from Debian 11 to Debian 12
    - Debian 12 released in June
    - SEAPATH was not fully working with Debian 12
        - Several upstream patches (FAI, Cluster) fixed
        - Branches are ready with CI running
    - TSC decided to:
        - Use Debian 12 as a official support for SEAPATH Debian
        - keep the Debian 11 without new features plan

- SEAPATH will be released. We would like first to harmonize both Debian and Yocto versions.

- Feedback on OSS Europe conference
    - conference regarding SBOM support, vulnerabilities 

- Feedback on SEAPATH deployment
    - GE deployed a POC with SEAPATH for National Grid (UK) with promising results with virtualized protections
    - Behavior with SR-IOV and DPDK proper behavior (jitter relating to wave form)
    - Schneider made its own benchmark with eSV with SR-IOV and DPDK (inside VM):
        - Wakeup every ms: measure the jitter
        - Get all the SV: stats gather by the software
    - Good results so far

- Cybersecurity auditing
    - Audit provided by LFEnergy with ostif
    - Preliminary discussions to define the scope

- Discussion regarding CIP project presentation
    - Technical scope of SEAPATH not covered:
        - more focus on Debiani than Yocto
        - some features of virtualization / HA would need to be added
    - No budget for the moment to pay membership to CIP
    - TSC decided that the discussion is too early for the moment

- Security certification
    - Need to be discussed with standard certification
    - Cybersecurity IEC62443 might be mandatory. Welotec will sum-up a scope of future work

## Vote

- SEAPATH Debian will now support Debian 12 instead Debian 11
- SEAPATH does not want to be involved with CIP for the moment

# Next TSC 

- Next TSC on 9th November 2023
- Agenda
    - IEC62443
    - Other points to be defined
